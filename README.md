# Dart Design Patterns Examples

A curated collection of **design pattern implementations** in [Dart](https://dart.dev/), designed to help developers understand and apply common software architecture solutions in real-world Dart and Flutter projects.

## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository provides **clear, concise, and runnable examples** of classic design patterns, each with:
- A brief description of the pattern
- A UML diagram (where applicable)
- Dart code implementation
- Example usage

Whether youâ€™re new to design patterns or need a quick reference for a project, this repo is meant to be your go-to guide.

## ðŸ“‚ Patterns Covered (till now)

<!-- ### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton** â€“ Ensure a class has only one instance.
- **Factory Method** â€“ Create objects without specifying the exact class.
- **Abstract Factory** â€“ Provide an interface for creating families of related objects.
- **Builder** â€“ Separate object construction from its representation.
- **Prototype** â€“ Clone objects without depending on their concrete classes. -->

<!-- ### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter** â€“ Allow incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge** â€“ Decouple an abstraction from its implementation.
- **Composite** â€“ Treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Decorator** â€“ Add behavior to objects dynamically.
- **Facade** â€“ Provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Flyweight** â€“ Minimize memory usage by sharing state.
- **Proxy** â€“ Control access to another object. -->

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility** â€“ Pass requests along a chain of handlers.
<!-- - **Command** â€“ Encapsulate requests as objects.
- **Interpreter** â€“ Define a grammar and interpret sentences in it.
- **Iterator** â€“ Traverse elements without exposing representation.
- **Mediator** â€“ Define an object to coordinate communication.
- **Memento** â€“ Capture and restore an objectâ€™s state. -->
- **Observer** â€“ Notify dependent objects of changes.
<!-- - **State** â€“ Change behavior when an objectâ€™s state changes.
- **Strategy** â€“ Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable.
- **Template Method** â€“ Define the skeleton of an algorithm.
- **Visitor** â€“ Separate algorithms from object structures. -->
